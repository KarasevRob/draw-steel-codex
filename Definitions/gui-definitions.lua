--- DockablePanel is implemented in the codex (DMHub Core UI/DockablePanel.lua).
--- Its table-constructor members are declared here because LuaLS binds this class
--- to this declaration, so fields in the codex's `DockablePanel = {...}` literal are
--- not seen. Members the codex adds with `DockablePanel.X = function` (StartProcess,
--- StopProcess, GetProcess, HasActiveProcess) are picked up from the codex directly.
--- @class DockablePanel
--- @field ContentWidth number Width in pixels of a docked panel's content.
